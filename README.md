# LostHosters-Internal
The server software used on all LostHoster servers.
## What is it?
It's really just a watered-down version of pocketmine, which focuses on load-balancing instead of features.
## How do I run it?
Grab a phar from the folder called STABLE, or get a release, [here](https://github.com/LostHosters/LostHosters-Internal/releases).
###### PLEASE NOTE: Anything in the folder `DEVELOPMENT` or `BETA` may not be 100% stable. It may be ok for private servers, but not for a production network.
